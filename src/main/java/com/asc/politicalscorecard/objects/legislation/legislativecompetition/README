### Legislative accountability competition

This section is used for objects and file references meant for refining or doing accountability
work on traditional legislative documents, or for performing attribution tying fragments of documentation
to structured contexts and scoring.

An 'assertion' in this system refers to a highlighted sub-section of text within a piece of legislation, which
something is associated with.  

Assertions, once made, can be voted on for validity over multiple rounds if necessary.

By using assertions we can convert more abstract legislative text into a format that can be associated with
more concrete data and analysis.

This section also acts as a means to allocate scores to historic actions to establish a baseline of studying
historically how certain policies and implementation approaches have performed.

Legislation is associated per legislative body and each legislative body is associated with both elected individuals and specific location objects.

Assertions on legislation may be made by individuals or by groups/organizations.

There are a few kinds of assertions that may be made.

(1) Positive Score Impact Assertions.
An assertion may be made in regards to either a segment of the document, or to a segment

(2) Negative Score Impact Assertions.


(3) Specific Policy Implementation Assertions.


(4) Abstract Policy Implementation Assertions.


(5) Implementing Group Assertions.


(6) Implementing Individual Assertions.
    - Asserts that 

(7) Dependency Legislation Assertions.

    - Asserts that another piece of legislation is being referenced within this legislation, meaning the scoring of that legislation
        should be carried into and applied towards this legislation.


(8) Decorative Text Assertions.
    - Used to indicate that this portion of the text is not actually useful or relevant and can be ignored without impact.
