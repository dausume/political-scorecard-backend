#### Policy Competition Objects Readme
### Policy Flow or Operational Competition

Policy in the context described here does not refer to documentation, for that refer to legislative document competition.

In this context policy refers specifically to policy or business logic in respect to how it might be described/explained via
flow chart diagrams.

Slight variations in ways policy can be implemented can have enormous impacts on communities, and sometimes variations in traits
of communities may mean policy can have different impacts.

Because of this we isolate and record different variations in policy proposed by different groups and individuals, such that 
the policy variations can have assertions placed on them in terms of scoring.  These variations should also allow for context
specification assertions, which may be reasons for why their own policy differs.  This context and the reasoning for it may be disputed
and voted on for validity by different competing groups.
