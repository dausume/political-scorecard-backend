### Term Competition

Terms are specific metrics refined in respect to a specific scientific context.

For any given Score there should be a specific scientific context.

This scientific context may allow for many Terms to be considered as valid for use by the
given score.

This can be referred to as the 'valid terms scope' or 'term scope'.

However, within a given term scope, there may be multiple terms that fulfill the same purpose.
These may be referred to as 'purpose-equivalent terms'.  However purpose-equivalent terms may
not all be equally appropriate for the given context.
